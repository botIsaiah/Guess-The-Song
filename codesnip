//This is a guess the song app where the user has to guess the Ed Sheeran song that is played
//once the play button is clicked. The user has 5 attempts to guess the song that is played.
//On attempt one, only one second of the song plays. On attempt two, two seconds of the song
//plays. On attempt three, five seconds of the song plays. On attempt four, ten seconds of
//the song plays. On attempt five, thirty seconds of the song plays.
//A bar just above the play button fills 

//When the user goes to enter the song in the user input, a dropdown with all
//Ed Sheeran songs will appear. As the user enters more letters, the number of songs in the
//dropdown reduces to match the letters entered.
//If the guess is correct, the user is brought to the answer screen where the song name and
//artist(s) is displayed. If the guess is incorrect, the guess is displayed on the home page.
//The user has 5 total attempts to get the song correct. After the five attemtps, the user is
//brought to the answer screen where the correct song name and artist(s) is displayed.

//The restart button brings the user to the home screen where they can try again.
//The song trivia button brings the user to a page where more information about the song is
//displayed.
//The how to play buttons bring the user to a page where they can read how to play the app.
//The information buttons bring the user to a page where they can read about the app.
